BlogMutt Idea Generator generates headlines and initial body content based on keywords you provide to help you with your next blog post.

This email will include five additional headlines ideas generated from the keywords you provide to keep your blogging momentum going. 

= BlogMutt Idea Generator Makes Developing Your Next Blog Post Easier =

If the stress of coming up with that next great blog idea is too intimidating, the BlogMutt Idea Generator can help. Sometimes, a great blog post starts with just a little push in the right direction.
 
= How the BlogMutt Idea Generator Plugin Works =

Once installed, the BlogMutt Idea Generator will prompt you to enter keywords that will serve as the starting point for automatically generating blog post ideas. A yellow lightbulb icon will appear in the editing toolbar. Clicking the lightbulb will generate a headline and text of initial content to get your next post started. 

After you install the BlogMutt Idea Generator and click the lightbulb one of two things will happen:

1. If you have not yet completed the required fields for the plugin to operate you will be prompted to do so.
or
2. A headline and initial body content will be generated incorporating your supplied keywords. 

You will be able to edit the post as you normally would in WordPress to fill in around the links and content  BlogMutt Idea Generator provides. Don’t like your generated headline and body content? Click the lightbulb and a new headline and initial body content will be created. 
 
= The BlogMutt Idea Generator Weekly Email =

In addition to getting blog post ideas from the BlogMutt Idea Generator plugin, we will also send you a weekly email (Example_Email.jpg) containing:
• Five headlines generated from the list of keywords you provided
• Instructions on how to get the headline turned into a post in the WordPress tool
• A link to change your keywords or email preferences
• A link to unsubscribe from the weekly email. Please note: You will be unsubscribed from the email but the plugin will remain installed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BlogMutt Idea Generator generate headlines and initial body content? =

The headline and body will be populated with a random headline generated from a database list of potential headlines. The content of the headline and body will be populated from a merge of your provided keywords and contact information with a content database made up of the very best prototype headlines shown to drive the highest engagement with readers.

(Just as an example, if you enter the keyword “baseball” a potential generated headline might be: “Three surprising things about baseball.”)

In addition to the headline, the blog will have all the data from the content database merged with all the user-supplied content to create the headline, links, etc., for the post. See screenshots for an example of how that will look.

With the “Contact Us” link, the text in the spreadsheet with data to fill in says [[CONTACT US]]. That will be replaced by the words “contact us” that are a link to the contact page information provided by the customer. If there is no contact link provided, that cell from the spreadsheet will not be inserted into the post.

The Google News link is to a link that includes the keyword. The text of the link will be “Search for “[[KEYWORD]]” on Google News” and that link will look like (using “baseball” as the keyword example): https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=baseball+-%22press+release%22
(Note that in addition to the keyword, the search contains, “-“press release”” or put in words, the minus sign followed by the phrase “press release” in quotes.)

= Can I change my keywords and contact information at any time? =

Yes. By going to the “Settings” page (Settings.jpg) and selecting BlogMutt, you can update your keywords and contact information at any time. 

= I don’t like my headline and body content, can I change it? =

Yes. You can simply click the lightbulb icon in the editing toolbar to generate a new headline and initial body content.
